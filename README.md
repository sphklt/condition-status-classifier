# Clinical Condition Status Classifier

A clinical NLP system that classifies whether a medical condition in clinical text is **ongoing**, **resolved**, **negated**, or **ambiguous** — at both the phrase level and the full note level.

**Key results** (127-phrase annotated evaluation set):
- Rule-based classifier: **89.8% accuracy**
- Hybrid triage: **100% recall of errors**, 62% of predictions auto-approved at 100% accuracy
- Calibration transfer: isotonic regression reduces ECE from 0.109 → 0.003 (**−97%**) using only synthetic training data
- 202 tests across 6 test files

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest                      # 202 passed
streamlit run app.py        # browser UI
python main.py              # CLI evaluation
```

**Optional — SciSpaCy NER** (improves entity recall on real notes; requires Python 3.11):

```bash
pip install scispacy==0.5.4
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.4/en_ner_bc5cdr_md-0.5.4.tar.gz
```

Without SciSpaCy, the system uses a vocabulary-based NER covering ~85 common clinical conditions with no setup required.

## Status Labels

| Label | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `ongoing` | Condition is active, persistent, stable, controlled, or currently changing | `"Persistent cough for 2 weeks"`, `"Diabetes is stable"`, `"Seizures controlled on medication"` |
| `resolved` | Condition is historical, closed, or no longer active | `"History of asthma"`, `"Fever has resolved"`, `"s/p appendectomy"` |
| `negated` | Condition is explicitly denied or absent | `"Patient denies chest pain"`, `"No evidence of pneumonia"`, `"Fever -ve"` |
| `ambiguous` | Condition is uncertain, suspected, or unconfirmed | `"Possible pneumonia"`, `"Rule out sepsis"`, `"Concern for pulmonary embolism"` |

**Important nuance — "better" is ongoing, not resolved:**

```
Asthma better today  →  ongoing
```

"Better" means the condition has improved but is still present. Words like `stable`, `controlled`, `improving`, and `better` all signal an active condition being managed — not a resolved one.

---

## How It Works

### Five non-trivial capabilities

**1. Pseudo-negation filtering (NegEx-inspired)**

Some phrases contain negation words that do not deny a condition. These patterns are detected and masked before cue scoring.

| Phrase | Naive | This system | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `No longer has headache` | `negated` | `resolved` | "no longer" = condition ended, not denied |
| `Not improving on current regimen` | `negated` | `ongoing` | condition present, not responding |
| `No improvement noted` | `negated` | `ongoing` | condition persists unchanged |
| `No change in diabetes status` | `negated` | `ongoing` | unchanged = still present |

**2. Adversative clause detection**

When a sentence has clauses separated by an adversative conjunction or a period, the final clause carries the definitive status.

```
"I had severe flu which I think is getting better now.
 But after a couple of days, it got completely over."
→ resolved  (final clause wins; first clause ignored)
```

**3. Temporal signal detection**

Past and present temporal expressions boost the relevant label score independently of keyword cues.

| Phrase | Signal | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `"DM diagnosed 3 years ago"` | past | boosts resolved |
| `"Chest pain since this morning"` | present | boosts ongoing |
| `"Was treated for pneumonia last year"` | past | boosts resolved |
| `"Acute onset shortness of breath"` | present | boosts ongoing |

**4. Sentence-boundary-aware context windows**

Entity classification uses only the sentence containing the entity — not a fixed character window. This prevents signals from adjacent sentences from bleeding into the wrong classification.

```
"No fever.  Patient has diabetes."
 ─────────  ─────────────────────
 sentence 1   sentence 2 → "No" from sentence 1 never reaches diabetes
```

**5. Pronoun coreference within sections**

When a pronoun sentence contains a confident status signal and the entity's own sentence was uninformative, the status is attributed to the most recent entity in the same section.

```
"The patient had a cough. It resolved."
                          ──────────── → cough: resolved (87% conf)
```

Coref fires only when the entity's own sentence confidence < 0.65, ensuring it never overrides a confident classification. Coref is section-scoped.

### Design decisions

**Why rule-based rather than ML?**

Every prediction can be traced to a specific cue, temporal expression, or section prior. An ML baseline (TF-IDF + logistic regression, trained on the same 2,850 synthetic phrases) shows exactly where domain engineering wins:

| System | Accuracy | Misclassified |
|---|---|---|
| Rule-based (this system) | **97%** | 1 / 39 |
| TF-IDF + logistic regression | 90% | 4 / 39 |

| Phrase | Gold | ML predicts | Why ML fails |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"Asthma better today"` | `ongoing` | `resolved` | "better" correlates with resolved in training data |
| `"s/p appendectomy"` | `resolved` | `ongoing` | abbreviation not expanded before ML sees it |
| `"Cough, no improvement noted"` | `ongoing` | `negated` | ML sees "no"; rule system masks pseudo-negation |

**Why weighted multi-signal scoring rather than priority order?**

The original system used fixed priority: negated → ambiguous → resolved → ongoing. This fails when two signals appear in the same phrase:

```
"History of asthma, currently worsening"
 → Priority order: resolved (first cue found)
 → Weighted scoring: ongoing (worsening 0.95 + currently 0.90 + bonus > history of 0.95)
```

**Why a two-level pipeline?**

The phrase classifier is optimised for short, focused input. The pipeline feeds it exactly what it needs — a single sentence from the appropriate section — without the classifier needing to know how sections, NER, or sentence splitting work.

## Research

### Calibration Transfer

**Motivation.** Rule-based systems assign confidence scores based on how strongly rules fire, not empirical accuracy. These scores are systematically miscalibrated. The key question: can a calibration model fitted on *synthetic* template-generated phrases transfer to *real* clinical text?

> *Miscalibration is driven by rule activation patterns, not surface form variation. Calibration models therefore transfer from synthetic to real text.*

**Setup:**

| | |
|---|---|
| Training set | 2,850 synthetic phrases (`data/calibration_phrases.csv`); 88.4% classifier accuracy |
| Test set | 127 real phrases (`data/clinical_phrases.csv`); 89.8% classifier accuracy |
| Methods | Uncalibrated · Platt scaling · Isotonic regression · Temperature scaling |

**Results:**

| Method | ECE | Brier | ECE vs raw |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uncalibrated | 0.109 | 0.091 | — |
| Platt scaling | 0.065 | 0.071 | −40% |
| **Isotonic regression** | **0.003** | **0.061** | **−97%** |
| Temperature scaling | 0.130 | 0.095 | +20% |

Per-category ECE:

| Category | n | Uncalibrated | Platt | Isotonic | Temperature |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ongoing | 42 | 0.259 | **0.093** | 0.153 | 0.236 |
| resolved | 38 | 0.116 | 0.083 | **0.032** | 0.102 |
| negated | 22 | 0.142 | 0.115 | **0.095** | 0.157 |
| ambiguous | 25 | 0.140 | 0.176 | **0.116** | 0.164 |

**Interpretation.** Isotonic regression transfers nearly perfectly (ECE 0.003), confirming the transfer hypothesis. Temperature scaling fails (ECE +20%) because miscalibration is non-uniform — a single global scalar cannot correct category-specific over/under-confidence. For `ongoing`, Platt scaling (ECE 0.093) outperforms isotonic (0.153) due to wider score spread; isotonic dominates for `resolved` and `negated`.

Reproduce: `python experiments/calibration_transfer.py`

### Bayesian Evidence Fusion

**Motivation.** The rule-based classifier returns a single confidence score and argmax — no distribution, no uncertainty. Bayesian fusion treats cue weights as calibrated likelihood ratios and accumulates evidence into a proper posterior.

**Algorithm.** For each label ℓ ∈ {ongoing, resolved, negated, ambiguous}:

```
log_score[ℓ] = log P(label=ℓ | section)       ← section-conditional prior
             + Σ log(w / (1-w))                ← for each cue targeting ℓ
             - Σ log(w' / (1-w')) / 3          ← for each cue targeting ℓ' ≠ ℓ

posterior[ℓ] = softmax(log_score)[ℓ]
```

Cue weights (w) are already calibrated precision estimates from `rules.py`, so calibration propagates at the feature level. Section priors encode clinical domain knowledge (PMH → resolved=0.55; HPI/Assessment → ongoing=0.50). Temporal signals contribute their own LLRs (e.g., past temporal → +0.85 to resolved). Cues with w ≤ 0.50 are skipped (LLR ≤ 0 = no positive evidence).

**Results** (127 real phrases):

| System | Accuracy | ECE |
|---|---|---|
| Rule-based | **89.8%** | 0.109 |
| Bayesian fusion | 87.4% | 0.125 |

Per-label ECE — Bayesian wins on 3 of 4 categories:

| Label | Rule ECE | Bayes ECE |
|---|---|---|
| ongoing | 0.259 | **0.215** |
| resolved | 0.116 | **0.104** |
| negated | 0.142 | **0.131** |
| ambiguous | **0.140** | 0.190 |

**Entropy as triage signal:**

| Prediction type | Mean entropy |
|---|---|
| Correct predictions | 0.75 bits |
| Wrong predictions | 1.85 bits |
| Ratio | **2.5× higher on errors** |

Wrong predictions have 2.5× higher entropy than correct ones, making entropy a reliable flag for routing uncertain predictions to human review.

### Hybrid Classifier

`src/hybrid.py` combines the rule-based MAP label with Bayesian uncertainty into a single triage-aware result.

**Triage logic:** a prediction is flagged when either:
- Bayesian entropy > 1.2 bits (tunable default)
- The two systems predict different labels

```python
from src.hybrid import classify

result = classify("History of poorly controlled hypertension.")
# result["status"]       → "resolved"       (rule-based MAP)
# result["posterior"]    → {"ongoing": 0.47, "resolved": 0.38, ...}
# result["entropy"]      → 1.21 bits        (two signals compete)
# result["triage_flag"]  → True             (flagged for review)
# result["runner_up"]    → ("ongoing", 0.47)
```

**Triage performance** (127-phrase set, default threshold 1.2 bits):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Phrases flagged | 48 / 127 (38%) |
| Recall of errors | **100%** — every wrong prediction flagged |
| Precision | 27% — 1 in 3.7 flagged phrases is an actual error |
| Auto-approved accuracy | **100%** — 62% of predictions, no errors |
| Review efficiency | **2.6×** fewer phrases read per error |

At best-F1 threshold (1.8 bits): 21% flagged, 77% recall, 37% precision.

The threshold is tunable. `evaluate_triage(csv_path, thresholds=[...])` sweeps thresholds and returns precision/recall/F1 at each.

## Limitations

| Limitation | Potential improvement |
|---|---|
| NER misses rare conditions, specialist terminology, and misspellings | Fine-tuned clinical NER or BERT-based token classifier trained on de-identified notes |
| Rule-based classification plateaus on novel phrasing and conditions outside the cue vocabulary | Fine-tuned BERT / clinical LLM trained on labelled clinical notes |
| Platt scaler fitted on 2,850 synthetic phrases — less reliable at the tails | Collect ≥500 real labelled phrases and refit |
| Dep-tree heuristics can mis-scope modifiers in complex multi-clause sentences | Dedicated relation extraction model linking negation/temporality to entity spans |
| Pronoun coreference fails when multiple entities are plausible antecedents | Neural coreference resolution (e.g. SpanBERT-based) |
| Section prior threshold (0.55) is not empirically calibrated | Tune on a held-out annotated note set |
| Dep parser silently degrades to regex-only if `en_core_web_sm` is not installed | Surface a clear warning in the UI and CLI |
